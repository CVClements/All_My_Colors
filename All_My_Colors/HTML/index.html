    <p>Dear Parents, 
        
        What do you do when your child has big feelings and doesn't know how to explain?

        Colors have meaning to kids. Colors can talk for them.
        
        Using the  All My Colors mobile app, your child can choose a bubble of color that shows their mood, whether bright or calm, vivid or gentle. You can encourage your child's emotional awareness even when they are young. 
        
        Start the conversation with color.</p>
